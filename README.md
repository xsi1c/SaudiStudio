# Teleport Control

This is a script that saves you from losing the bounty in some games in Roblox
this is a beta version so I do not recommend using it in games with high security
systems like Blox Fruit as there is a chance of getting banned.

## Scripts

- **main.lua**: The main script that ties everything together.
- **ui.lua**: Handles the creation and management of the UI.
- **tools.lua**: Manages the creation of the teleport tool.

## Usage

1. Place the scripts in the appropriate locations in your Roblox game.
2. Ensure the `main.lua` script is executed to initialize the system.
3. Players can use the UI to set locations, teleport, and manage health thresholds.
